# customer-shopping-report
As an aspiring data analyst I decided to analyzed dataset on customer shopping data base the data was retrieved from kaggle.com. during this process I noticed age need to be grouped conditional column was applied on power query by grouping the "Age category", each if [age] <= 30 then "YOUTH" else if [age] <= 50 then "ADULT" else "OLD") by this I was able to learn some M language like (IF) and Switch. in terms of shopping clothing and shoe which was purchased higher among the FEMALE AND MALE.
